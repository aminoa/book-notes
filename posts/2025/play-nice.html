        I started this book late November last year and I finished it yesterday
        on April 7th, so it took me about 5 months to finish this book (wow).
        I’ll have text blurbs for interesting ideas from the book rather than
        serving as a chronological summary. Also, this will be one of the longer
        summaries, most of my summaries in the future will likely only be a
        couple paragraphs or so.

    <h2 id="early-years-at-blizzard">Early Years at Blizzard</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                1991: Blizzard was founded as Silicon and Synapse by Allen Adham
                and Mike Morhaime, graduates from UCLA.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Taking contracts from Interplay with assistance from Brian Fargo
                but created their first game, Warcraft, as a multiplayer fantasy
                variant of Dune II.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Warcraft II emphasized approachability and depth for the sequel
                and was the first big success, selling 1 million copies, as well
                as establishing the company structure of QA teams.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Diablo was developed by a separate studio (Condor) as a
                contract.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Compensation was continually stifled and there was continual
                crunch.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Starcraft was a massive success, in particular benefitting from
                internet infrastructure being built in Thailand and South Korea
                and the start of PC Cafes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Blizzard attempted to make a point and click adventure Warcraft
                game but canceled it, even after bringing in Steve Meretzky, the
                legendary designer behind adventure games like Sorceror and Zork
                Zero.

                    2008: development began as a new MMORPG, combining FPS game
                    with sim game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    FPS portion was prelude to Overwatch which was a grand
                    success for Blizzard, though not completely satisfying

                <li>
                    Financial people at the game recommended that they don’t
                    overcharge so monetization serves players well - this never
                    happened at the company again

                        <li>
                            Valve contacted the developer and helped create DotA

                    Pat Wyatt came up a novel idea: to provide free online
                    infrastructure for Diablo and Starcraft,

                        <li>
                            Mike Morhaime approved, wanting to serve the players
                            right.

                    He thought of a lucrative, industry-changing initiative: to
                    turn Battle.net into a digital store for a variety of PC
                    games instead of just Blizzard’s (this was shot down by
                    executives who wanted to focus on Blizzard).

                <li>
                    That company committed substantial financial fraud
                    (overstating merger reserves that were reported as

            2008: Activision merged itself with Vivendi Games, with Kotich

            After Starcraft took off in Korea, KESPA was founded to handle

            Overwatch emphasized esports with a professional league owned and

                    Blizzard was interested in investing in Twitch but

                    OVerwatch also introduced lootboxes (1 billion in revenue)

                <li>
                    They charged $20 million per franchise (Kotich pushed the
                    number so high to get the interest of billionaire sports
                    teams owners to invest)

                            Overwatch League was different in that the

            commercialization (including sponsorships)

        <li>
            Overwatch 2, with most of its development focused on a PvE mode
            rather than the main PvP mode, came out half-baked.
        </li>

            The pandemic and the switch to YouTube were the final nails in the

                Bobby Kotich grew up always interested in generating profits

                    Kotich acquired the company, renamed it to its old name
                    Activision, and was ruthless, heavily rewarding and
                    punishing the people there.
