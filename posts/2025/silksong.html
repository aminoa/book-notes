            It&#39;s up there as one of the hardest games I've beaten (harder
            than Dark Souls 3 or Super Meat Boy), but it was worth it.

            There were too many required missions to reach Act 3 - the fetch
            quests felt like a waste; I also didn't understand why the
            requirements needed to be obtuse.

            Some of the runbacks were painful - in particular, Bilewater has an
            initially massive runback (15 minutes!) that can be brought down to
            about 5 minutes if you find a secret bench. That's still too much.

            The true final boss, Lost Lace, is my favorite - it really goes
            against your built-up instincts, leading to thoughtful play.

        This is my biggest flaw with Silksong. The bosses scale well throughout
        the game (The Last Judge in Act 1 -&gt; Grand Mother Silk in Act 2 -&gt;
        Lost Lace in Act 3 - a solid progression). However, the game takes a
        massive difficulty spike whenever you have to handle hordes of enemies
        in a row. I find this especially frustrating when it&#39;s incorporated
        before a boss fight starts, as it begins to test my patience. The
        biggest examples are the High Halls Gauntlet Battle, which was probably
        the most challenging section in Act 2 or Act 1, and felt substantially
        harder than Clockwork Dancers or, frankly, any boss beforehand. Then, in
        Act 3, the Coral Towers enemy gauntlet (which you complete to get the
        Heart of Might) almost made me drop the game - the game wanted too much
        endurance, and it's not fun to have to spend 10 minutes refighting easy
        enemies to get to the actual challenging wave of enemies.

        As a player, coordinating against several game AIs with wildly varying
        behavior while also being able to take on these enemies is too much of a
        mental load within a one-second timeframe. The player is required to
        take extremely slow and defensive strategies (i.e., walljump to the top
        of the screen, throw out a charger attack at a couple of flying/grounded
        enemies, then run to the other side of the arena and repeat). This kills
        the pace of the fights, and if the player makes a mistake, it is very
        tempting to try and get in a couple of extra hits so you can move onto
        the next enemy wave and get back to where you were. My memory of Hollow
        Knight is a bit fuzzy, but I don't remember struggling nearly as much
        when there were enemy gauntlets. A part of this may stem from the double
        damage from enemies; a hit hurts more when you can only afford 2-3
        mistakes.
